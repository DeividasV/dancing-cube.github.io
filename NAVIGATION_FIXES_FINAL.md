# Navigation Issues Fixed

## Issues Resolved

### 1. **HOME Button HTML Attribute Issue**

**Problem:** The HOME button was showing HTML tooltip text like `title="Back to Home" >Home` instead of working properly.

**Root Cause:** Malformed HTML where `<button>` and `<a>` tags were incorrectly merged during the automated fix process.

**Solution:**

- Fixed all HOME buttons to use consistent structure: `<button class="nav-button home-button" data-nav="home">HOME</button>`
- Removed malformed HTML attributes and tags

### 2. **infinite-knot.html Missing Top Menu**

**Problem:** The infinite-knot.html file had corrupted HTML structure preventing the top menu from displaying.

**Root Cause:**

- Missing closing tag for stylesheet link
- Malformed button structure with mixed `<a>` and `<button>` elements
- Duplicate closing `</div>` tags

**Solution:**

- Fixed HTML structure and closing tags
- Standardized all navigation buttons
- Removed duplicate elements

### 3. **HTML Structure Validation**

**Problem:** Several files had inconsistent or broken HTML structure after previous automated fixes.

**Solution:**

- Systematically verified and fixed all 13 exhibition files
- Ensured proper nesting of div elements
- Standardized button structure across all files
