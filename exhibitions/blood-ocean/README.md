# Blood Ocean - Production Ready

## Final Production Files

The exhibition has been cleaned up and optimized for production:

### Core Files (4 files total)

- **`index.html`** - Main exhibition page
- **`blood-ocean-renderer.js`** - High-performance wave renderer
- **`blood-ocean-audio.js`** - Production audio system
- **`blood-ocean-main.js`** - Integration and lifecycle management

### Removed Development Files

- ❌ `blood-ocean.js` - Original monolithic implementation
- ❌ `blood-ocean.js.original` - Backup of original
- ❌ `test.html` - Development test interface
- ❌ `debug.html` - Debug visualization
- ❌ `COMPARISON.md` - Before/after documentation
- ❌ `README-production.md` - Development documentation

### Optimizations Applied

- ✅ **Reduced console logging** - Only essential error logging remains
- ✅ **Clean code structure** - Removed commented debug code
- ✅ **Production focus** - Dark red infinite wave lines only
- ✅ **Minimal file size** - 1,775 total lines vs original 893+ scattered files

### Features

- **Solid dark bordeaux/red waves** extending to infinite perspective
- **Hi-DPI rendering** with device pixel ratio scaling
- **Frame-rate independent** smooth 60fps animation
- **Battery optimized** with visibility-based pausing
- **Production audio** with autoplay compliance
- **Clean modular architecture** for maintainability

The exhibition is now production-ready with minimal file footprint and maximum visual impact.
