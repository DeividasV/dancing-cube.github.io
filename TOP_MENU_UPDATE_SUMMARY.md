# Top Menu Navigation - Update Summary

## What Was Streamlined

### 1. **Unified Navigation Component**

- Created `js/top-menu.js` - a single, robust navigation system
- Replaced the old `js/exhibition-nav.js` with improved functionality
- Handles both keyboard (Arrow keys, A/D, H/Escape) and button navigation

### 2. **Removed All Icons**

- Eliminated arrow symbols (←, →) and home icon (⌂) from buttons
- Clean text-only navigation: "PREV", "NEXT", "HOME"
- Consistent typography across all exhibitions

### 3. **Fixed Navigation Issues**

- **Problem**: Some exhibitions used `<button id="prevButton">` while others used `<a class="prev-button">`
- **Solution**: Unified all to use `<button class="nav-button prev-button" data-nav="prev">PREV</button>`
- Navigation now works consistently across ALL exhibitions

### 4. **Standardized Button Structure**

All exhibition files now use this consistent structure:

```html
<div class="top-menu">
  <div class="nav-left">
    <div class="menu-title">EXHIBITION_NAME</div>
  </div>
  <div class="nav-right">
    <button class="nav-button prev-button" data-nav="prev">PREV</button>
    <button class="nav-button next-button" data-nav="next">NEXT</button>
    <button class="nav-button home-button" data-nav="home">HOME</button>
  </div>
</div>
```
